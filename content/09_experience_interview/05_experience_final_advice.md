## Experience Interview: Final Advice
If you do the homework in Mental Game and Communication, you are pretty much ready for the Experience Interview!

Again, it’s hard to know the questions you will be asked, but if you keep the goal in mind — that you are being asked to demonstrate specific culture traits, and demonstrate your previous scope — the answers will come naturally.

Our final piece of advice for you in this interview is -- do not try to pretend. Simply own exactly where you are at — pretending will come through. What you’re trying to do is to find a job that fits with you, and this is exactly the interview to do that.

Now, you’re ready for the experience interview!

### Homework
* Ensure you’ve down your homework in Mental Game, Communication, and Technical Screens
