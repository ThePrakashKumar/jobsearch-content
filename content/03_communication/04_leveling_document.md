# Leveling

This document goes over each level you need to be aware of, alongside their technical and people expectations. 

We suggest using the document in two ways: 

1. **Form a conviction for your level**
    
    Follow the homework in *Communicating Signal*. You should have proof and confidence in your level, and where you follow in the range on that level.

2. **Get a sense of the compensation ranges**

    For each level, we've included the names that most companies use for it. Go on [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi), and take a peak at compensation around your level. you will be asked during interviews what your expectations are, and when time comes to communicate numbers, saying accurate numbers with strength sends positive signal.


## New-Grad 

- **Alternate names: E3/L3, SDE 1**
- **Experience Range: 1-2 years**

The New Grad level is given to people who join right out of college. This is often *the only* time where companies assign this level. **If this is not your first job search**,  carry on to the level above.

### Technical Expectations

You complete *tasks defined by others* with speed, resourcefulness, and proactivity. You can take ownership over a task, and deliver it *on time* with *little guidance*. 

To do this, you use a combination of your technical ability -- navigiating the codebase, debugging -- and your resourcefulness -- researching, reaching out to people, asking for help with clear questions. 

The tasks you take on are often *guaranteed* to have a solution, and can be done within a week or two.

### People Expectations

The main people dimensions at this level is *how you handle feedback*, and *how proactive you are*. 

You learn quickly and are constantly searching for feedback. When you get it, you take it positively, and look for tangible ways to improve immediately.

When a task is confusing, or you reach an impass you don't know how to solve, you demonstrate positivity and proactivity, by asking for help, and remaining confident in your ability to complete the task. 

You communicate well, and are proactively updating everyone around you about the timeline for your project when it changes.
